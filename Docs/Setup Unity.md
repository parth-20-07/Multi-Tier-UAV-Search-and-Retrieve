# Unity Hub

First task for making the project run is to download UnityHub.

1. [Click Link to Download UnityHub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
2. Once on the website, Select the `Download Unity Hub` Button. We want the complete unity hub, not just unity software.
3. Install the Unity Hub, when asked for license, select and create a Personal License.
4. Go to the `Installs` Tab and Select `Install Editor` on top-right of the window.
5. Our Project is using ***V2021.3.18f1*** [^1] so it is advised to locate that.
6. When the required version is found, press `Install` button.
7. Under the Platforms tab, choose the required one:
   1. `Android Build Support`
   2. `Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)`
   3. `iOS Build Support`
   4. `Linux Build Support`
8. Finally Press the `Install` on bottom right and wait for the whole setup to finish.
9. After the Install, close the Unity Hub.
